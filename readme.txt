This project is a Weather Application. You can see weather for 3 cities: Beijing, New York and Brussels. In addition to
this, I have added a search functionality which will allow you to find the weather of any city. I have also added a 
feature which allows you to see the current time in the cities. This application is designed considering responsive
development.


This project was part of interview process for one of the company I interviewed in 2017.

Develop an angular app that displays today’s weather at the below cities. 
Beijing, Brussels, New York 
Use the OpenWeatherMap API as your data source 
https://openweathermap.org/current 
You have six hours to complete this task. We accept incomplete or partially completed solutions if you run out of time. 
Considerations: 
1. You can use Angular 1.* or 2.0 
2. Make architecture decisions based on the assumption that this page is part of a much larger application. 
3. Design for performance: Page will be accessed by users from all of NYCO stores with varying connection speeds. 
4. Optional – Design your UI to be responsive to the screen size of the user. 
5. Optional - Cache weather info locally in browser after first load and reload after a certain time as elapsed. 
6. Optional - Use the provided images to make the page visually appealing. 
7. If the instructions don’t provide you guidance on something, please make any required assumptions.
